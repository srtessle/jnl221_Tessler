			<h3>DWI arrests have been cut in half since 2010</h3>

			<p> As of 2010, there were just over 1,600 DWI arrests in Onondaga County. That number was been brought down to under 800 as of 2022. This is while the total population of Onondaga County increased by just under 10,000 people from 2010-2020. There were two main reasons for the decline, according to Barry Weiss, STOP-DWI Coordinator for Onondaga County. First, he pointed out that the drop from 2017-2019 is due to the rise in ridesharing apps.
				
				<br>“People are realizing they’re not able or shouldn’t drink and drive, and they have the ability, through apps and everything else, to get it right through Uber and Lyft,” Weiss said.</br>
			<br>The realization has also contributed to the rise of ridesharing companies like Uber. In 2017, Uber had 58 million users, and they have over 130 million users as of 2023, according to Uber company statistics. While ridesharing apps have increased in popularity over the past few years, they weren’t the first solution to drunk driving in Onondaga County. In the 1970’s, a ride along program called “I’m Smart” was created. </br>
			<br>“If you had a membership, and Syracuse University had memberships for all employees, then you could call a number. They would come and someone from I’m smart would drive you and your car home,” Weiss said.</br>
			<br>I’m Smart was shut down in 2008, but it wasn’t before the program provided over 50,000 rides, according to Syrcause.com.</br>
			<br>The pandemic is the second factor to the decrease in DWI Arrests, according to Weiss. The mixture of bars temporarily closing and less card on the road contributed to the pandemics overall impact on decreasing DWI arrests. However, with the pandemic in the past, DWI arrests are starting to rise again. In 2023, DWI arrests went back up to around 1,100, Weiss said. This is still less than the pre-pandemic numbers, but it suggests that the pandemic no longer has an impact on the DWI numbers anymore.</br>

			<h3>Drug arrests have a similar trend</h3>
			<p>Drug Arrests in Onondaga County have also declined since 2017.  However, the initial increase of Drug Arrests from 2010-2017 is due to the increase in number Drug Recognition Officers in Onondaga County, according to Weiss.<br>
			<br>“In 2008 or 2009, there were only two. Currently, there are 14, so that’s increased. So, the ability to make those determinations have improved,” Weiss said.</br> 
			<br>The way many drug arrests are determined are through the 14 officers specialized in drug recognition. It takes two years of training and classes to be an official drug recognition officer, according to Weiss. So, the addition of officers was gradual. Weiss encourages police chiefs to have their officers take the drug recognition training. However, drug arrests did heavily decline during the pandemic, and it was due to the procedure drug testing. For the police to test for drugs, they must get a saliva sample. In 2020, police decided to temporarily halt the test for protection, according to Weiss.</br>
			<br>"Many police chiefs basically said, ‘hey we’re not going to do that’, because we want to protect our officers,” Weiss said. </br>
			<br>The standard practice of drug tests has been back since the end of the pandemic. However, it is not known if that has increased the number of drug arrests as of 2023 and 2024.</br>

			<h3>STOP-DWI's contributions</h3>
			<p> STOP-DWI, Special Traffic Options Program for Driving While Impaired, was created in 1981 by New York State Legislature. Their mission is to prevent deaths from drug or alcohol impaired driving, and to encourage the prevention of DWIs, according to the program’s website. The program attempts to meet their goals by focusing on seven efforts:
			<ul>
				<li>Law Enfrocement</li>
				<li>Prosecution</li>
				<li>Probation</li>
				<li>Rehabilitation</li>
				<li>Public Information</li>
				<li>Education</li>
				<li>Administration</li>
			</ul>
			<br>This program differs from many other government programs due to it only being funded through the fines that drunk drivers pay. No tax dollars have been used on the program. While the program was created for the whole state, each county gets freedom on how they allocate the fine money, according to Weiss.</br>

			<br>“It’s a local option. So, what we do here in Onondaga County is different than in Monroe, Westchester, or Essex County. But they all fill out the same components of enforcement, prosecution, probation, public information, and administration,” Weiss said. </br>

			<br>With the program needing drunk driving fines to operate, some parts of the state have police intentionally look for DWI’s, according to Weiss.</br>

			<br>“There had been, in other parts of the state, where if you assigned a police officer to every bar in the area and when it closes at 2:00 A.M., have the officers follow everyone out, then you’re going to automatically jump your numbers up,” Weiss said. 
	        </br> 

	        <br> While other counties have fished for DWI arrests, Weiss made it clear that the practice has not been done in Onondaga County. Still though, Onondaga County got around 700,000$ from DWI fines in 2023, according to Weiss. </br>
